        <div class="post-content">
          <p> If somebody had told me a week ago that I would start a <strong>blog</strong>
            , I wouldn't have believed them </p>
            <p>Just a few days later, I started working on a <em>real</em> blog. This is my first post
            and my first week doing so, so the site is kinda basic but we're gonna be making so improvements soon.
          Hopefully within the next week I'll be able to get it so that you guys can subscribe, leave comment, and
        really join the Jazzy Blogz movement. There's a team of us so you'll see different posters... posterers?
      Whatever anyway thanks for checking us out and we look forward to giving you solid content.</p>
